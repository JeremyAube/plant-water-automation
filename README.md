# Plant Watering Automation

This project is a hobby project to help me with the watering of my plants. Since
I am not so great at remembering to water them and I am not always around during
the summer. I will try to automate the process with microcontrollers, soil
sensors and 5v water pumps

## In the future

For the moment the ESP32 support for Rust seems to be lacking, for this reason
I will write the code using C. When Rust support for this board will get better
I might change the code to Rust
