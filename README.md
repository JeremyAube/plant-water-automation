# Plant Watering Automation

## Motivation

This project is a hobby project to help me with the watering of my plants. Since
I am not so great at remembering to water them and I am not always around during
the summer. I will try to automate the process with microcontrollers, soil
sensors and 5v water pumps.

I am also increasingly interested in IoT and embedded programming. This project
will serve as a way to learn the basics of circuts and embedded programming. I 
know basicaly nothing at the time of starting this project.

## Future

The ESP32 code is currently programmed in C because there is not a ton of
resources for rust on the ESP32 at this time. Eventualy I would like to port all
C code to Rust.
